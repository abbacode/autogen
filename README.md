# Overview

Autogen allows the creation of word documents and visio diagrams from templates. The templates rely on the Jinja2
template engine to render and create new documents based on variables stored in an external excel spreadsheet.

## Why Use Autogen?

Consultants typically use these three products when generating statement of works, design documents, as-built documents,
change plans, etc and it is a slow and tedious process that is often error prone.

For large and compelx engagements were dozens or hundreds of sites are involved the problem is amplified.
Given that information is now distributed across multiple sources it is also difficult to automate as the data
quickly becomes out of sync.

With Autogen, consultants and engineers can leverage a single data source (Excel) for their engagements and use this
for all aspects of the project life cycle. From design to implementation to as-built document generation, all your
data is in a single place and can be generate on demand using templates.

## External Requirements

- Microsoft Visio must be installed on the local machine.

## Example Usuage
